							<h3 class="sub-title">Publishers Weekly - Starred Review</h3>
							<p>"In this picture book, Collins sensitively examines the impact of war on the very young, using her own family history as a template. Suzy is the youngest of four children—Proimos draws her with impossibly big, questioning blue eyes and a mass of frizzy red hair—and she is struggling to understand the changes in her family. 'My dad has to go to something called a war,' she explains. 'It's in a place called Viet Nam. Where is Viet Nam? He will be gone a year. How long is a year? I don't know what anybody's talking about.' When Suzy learns that her father is in the jungle, she imagines something akin to the setting of her favorite cartoon (Collins suggests it's George of the Jungle). As the months wear on, though, Suzy begins to piece together the danger her father is in, whether it's through the increasingly unnerving postcards he sends (one reads, 'Pray for me,' in closing) or by catching a snippet of wartime violence on the news. 'Explosions. Helicopters. Guns. Soldiers lie on the ground. Some of them aren't moving.' In four wordless spreads, Proimos makes Suzy's awakening powerfully clear, as the gray jungle she initially pictured (populated by four smiling, brightly colored animals) gives way to a more violent vision, as the animals morph into weapons of war. Just when Suzy's confusion and fear reach an apex: 'Then suddenly my dad's home.' As in Collins's Hunger Games books, the fuzzy relationship between fear and bravery, and the reality of combat versus an imagined (or, in the case of those books, manufactured) version of it is at the forefront of this story. By the final pages, Suzy has come to understand that 'Some things have changed but some things will always be the same.' It's a deceptively simple message of reassurance that readers who may currently be in Suzy's situation can take to heart, whether their loved ones return changed, as hers did, or don't return at all. Ages 4–up."</p>

							<h3 class="sub-title">The New York Times - Danielle Trussoni</h3>
							<p>"Suzanne Collins, author of the famously bloody 'Hunger Games' trilogy, has written a picture-book memoir about what life at home is like for a child whose father has gone away to war. Collins's own father went to Vietnam the year she turned 6, and she's said the experience had a profound effect on him. But though post-traumatic stress disorder is often spoken of these days, the more subtle effects of war on the children of men and women serving abroad are less well known. 'Year of the Jungle' is narrated by a little red-haired girl named Sue, whose father reads her poems by Ogden Nash. Her favorite is about a dragon named Custard that 'keeps crying for a nice safe cage.' Sue thinks that while Custard 'always feels afraid, he is really the bravest of all. And that's what makes him special.' When her father leaves for Vietnam, Sue must follow Custard's example. The year 'goes on and on.' Sue waits. She measures the passing of time by the arrival of a turkey, a Christmas tree, shamrocks and colored eggs. There is a postcard with a picture of Saigon, then one with a picture of a Vietnamese fisherman. The children watch their mother, worried she might be 'going to the jungle, too,' but she stays. Sue's initial impression of the jungle is positive. Her 'favorite cartoon character lives in a jungle,' and she thinks she'd like to go to Vietnam to find her father. She will fly there. 'You can fly anywhere in your dreams.' But over the course of the year, the dream begins to darken. The postcards stop coming. Then Sue's father sends her a birthday card when it isn't her birthday, and she begins to realize that 'the jungle must be a very confusing place' for her father to have made 'such a serious mistake.' One day, she watches graphic footage of the war on television, and her mother rushes in to turn off the set. Sue is afraid, but she doesn't have the language to describe her fear. She hides in the closet to cry alone. While Sue is not able to formulate her feelings in words, James Proimos's excellent illustrations capture her confusion. In one image, Sue imagines the landscape of Vietnam as a place with green elephants shooting white blobby monsters from their trunks and yellow goblins rising from coffee cups, while a rhino-shaped helicopter floats overhead. This visual nightmare mirrors a child's skewed perception of war so well that it is clear Sue is going through her own version of hell. At the end of the year, Sue's father returns, 'tired and thin,' his skin 'the color of pancake syrup.' He 'stares into space. He is here but not here.' 'Some things have changed,' Sue reflects, 'but some things will always be the same.' In other words, bad things happen, but life goes on. 'Year of the Jungle' may take place in the late 1960s, but with more than 2.3 million Americans deployed abroad between 2001 and 2012, the mixture of anxiety, excitement, fear, boredom and confusion Sue experiences on the home front will be sadly familiar to many children. For them, Collins's picture book may be a good tool to discuss the complex feelings war brings into a household. Children are sure to ask why Sue's father went away, and why he was different when he returned. Maybe some frank discussions about war, ones that involve more than stories about courageous dragons, will help children better understand what military service entails. 'Year of the Jungle' brings up big questions. Parents will need to provide the answers."</p>

							<h3 class="sub-title">USA Today - Bob Minzesheimer, 3 1/2 out of 4 stars</h3>
							<p>"Suzanne Collins' autobiographical picture book, Year of the Jungle: Memories from the Home Front, seems a sharp departure for the author of The Hunger Games, the best-selling dystopian trilogy. But in a reassuring and deceptively simple way, Jungle, aimed at readers 4 and up, continues Collins' exploration of the effect of war and violence on kids. In Hunger Games, for readers 12 and up, teens are forced to kill or be killed as part of state-sponsored entertainment. In Collins' first fantasy series, the Underland Chronicles, for readers 8 and up, two kids fall into an underground world on the brink of war. Jungle (Scholastic), illustrated by James Proimos, is narrated by Suzy, a frizzy-haired, big-eyed first grader whose dad is sent 'to something called a war' in a 'place called Viet Nam.' Suzy confesses, 'I don't know what anybody's talking about.' She measures time by holidays and learns to read a calendar. When her father's postcards arrive, they initially seem like 'secret code.' He sends a picture of a girl in traditional Vietnamese dress. 'Does he miss me?' Suzy wonders. After Christmas, she worries when his cards stop. She learns about the war on TV. 'Helicopters. Guns. Soldiers lie on the ground. Some of them aren't moving.' The images scare her and she hides in a closet to cry. When her dad comes home, he seems changed. He stares into space. But Suzy realizes, 'Some things have changed, but some things will always be the same.' Collins, 51, whose father served in Vietnam and Korea, has said she began Jungle in 2009, before The Hunger Games was published. She wrote it because young children 'also make sacrifices and face hardships' when parents go to war. The book, she hopes, 'will help them and their families.' USA TODAY says ***3 ½ stars out of four.***"</p>

							<h3 class="sub-title">The Guardian - Kate Kellaway</h3>
							<p>"This is a picture book with a difference from Suzanne Collins, author of the Hunger Games trilogy. She has teamed up with illustrator James Proimos to tell a story that takes place in 1968, when a father leaves for the Vietnam War. It is based on Collins' own experiences as a child. The result is a profound and moving autobiographical account of what it is like to have a parent go off to war – seen entirely through a child's eyes. Suzy is six years old and has frizzy red hair, big eyes and a face full of character. Collins tells the story simply but with astonishing depth. At first, Suzy is cheered by the postcards her father sends from Vietnam and fascinated by their strange stamps. But the year stretches out and becomes more and more frightening. She sees war on the television and begins to understand. The story does not end with unqualified happiness. Her father comes home but is a changed man. The power of this picture book lies in the steady unfolding of a small child's response to an event of huge significance."</p>
